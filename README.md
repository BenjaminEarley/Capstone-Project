# Capstone-Project

MySubs will allow a user to add his/her favorite subreddits and distribute posts from them equally in a list. Each subreddit will be collected in order of popularity. This allows the user to keep up all of of his/her favorite subreddits without the more popular subreddits drowning the others out.
